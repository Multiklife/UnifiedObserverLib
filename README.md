# UnifiedObserverLib

UnifiedObserverLib is a comprehensive Python library implementing the Unified Observer concept for advanced AI and machine learning applications. It provides tools for quantum-inspired neural networks, predictive modeling, ethical evaluation, and much more.

## Installation

You can install UnifiedObserverLib using pip:

```
pip install unified-observer-lib
```

## Features

- Unified Observer framework
- Quantum-inspired neural networks
- Self-observing optimization
- Reality wave function modeling
- Catastrophe theory analysis
- Topological data analysis
- Ethical evaluation
- Distributed computing support
- Advanced visualization tools
- Quantum machine learning integration

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use UnifiedObserverLib:

```python
from unified_observer_lib import UnifiedObserver, PredictiveModel, EthicalEvaluator

# Create a Unified Observer
uo = UnifiedObserver()

# Create a predictive model
model = PredictiveModel(uo)

# Train the model
X, y = ... # your data
model.train(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate ethical implications
evaluator = EthicalEvaluator([utilitarian_criterion, deontological_criterion])
ethical_score = evaluator.evaluate_action(predictions, context)
```
